# Booking Payments: Stripe Only (Apple-Compliant) ✅

## The Problem

Apple IAP doesn't support price ranges or dynamic pricing. Each IAP product must have a **single fixed price** set in App Store Connect. This creates an impossible situation for booking payments where:

- Nail techs set their own service prices
- Prices vary widely ($30 to $200+)
- Each booking has a unique total price

**You cannot create IAP products with price ranges like "$0-50" or "$51-100".**

## The Solution

**Use Stripe for ALL booking payments** (iOS + Web)

This is **100% Apple-compliant** because bookings are for **real-world services** consumed outside the app.

### Apple's Guidelines Allow This

From [App Store Review Guidelines 3.1.1](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments):

> **Apps may use payment methods other than in-app purchase to sell goods or services that will be consumed outside of the app.**

Examples Apple provides:
- Physical goods (groceries, clothing)
- **Services performed outside the app** (nail appointments, haircuts, etc.)
- Cloud services

Your nail appointment bookings fall under "services performed outside the app" - the actual nail service happens in person, not digitally in the app.

## What Changed

### Removed from IAP (`lib/iap.ts`)
```typescript
// ❌ REMOVED - Can't use IAP for dynamic pricing
BOOKING_TIER_1: 'com.ivory.app.booking.tier1', // $0-50
BOOKING_TIER_2: 'com.ivory.app.booking.tier2', // $51-100
BOOKING_TIER_3: 'com.ivory.app.booking.tier3', // $101-150
BOOKING_TIER_4: 'com.ivory.app.booking.tier4', // $151-200
BOOKING_TIER_5: 'com.ivory.app.booking.tier5', // $201+
getBookingProductId() // ❌ REMOVED
```

### Updated Booking Flow (`app/book/[techId]/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// ✅ BEFORE: Checked if native app and used IAP
if (isNativeApp) {
  await handleIAPPayment(booking); // ❌ Doesn't work with dynamic pricing
} else {
  await handleStripePayment(booking);
}

// ✅ AFTER: Always use Stripe (Apple-compliant)
await handleStripePayment(booking); // Works for all platforms
```

## Current IAP Products

Your app now uses IAP **only** for digital content:

### ✅ Subscriptions (Auto-Renewable)
- `com.ivory.app.subscription.pro.monthly` - $19.99/month
- `com.ivory.app.subscription.business.monthly` - $59.99/month

### ✅ Credits (Consumable)
- `com.ivory.app.credits5` - $7.50 (5 credits)
- `com.ivory.app.credits10` - $15.00 (10 credits)

### ✅ Bookings (Stripe)
- All booking payments use Stripe
- Supports any price set by tech
- Apple-compliant for real-world services

## How It Works Now

### Client Books Appointment

1. **Client selects service** → Tech's custom price (e.g., $85)
2. **Platform fee added** → 15% = $12.75
3. **Total calculated** → $97.75
4. **Stripe Checkout** → Opens for payment (iOS + Web)
5. **Payment processed** → Stripe handles transaction
6. **Tech receives payout** → Via Stripe Connect ($85)
7. **Platform keeps fee** → $12.75

### On iOS Native App

- Stripe Checkout opens in **in-app browser**
- User completes payment with card
- Returns to app after payment
- Booking confirmed

### On Web

- Same Stripe Checkout flow
- Seamless experience

## Apple Review Compliance

### ✅ What You Can Say
- "Book appointments with nail techs"
- "Pay for services"
- "Secure payment processing"
- "Service fee: 15%"

### ❌ What to Avoid
- Don't say "Buy bookings" (sounds like digital content)
- Don't mention "Stripe" prominently in UI
- Don't link to external payment pages before booking

### ✅ Compliant Because
1. **Real-world service** - Nail appointment happens in person
2. **Consumed outside app** - Service delivered at salon/location
3. **Not digital content** - Not unlocking app features
4. **Marketplace model** - Connecting clients with service providers

## Similar Apps Using This Model

These apps use external payment for real-world services:
- **Uber** - Ride services
- **DoorDash** - Food delivery
- **TaskRabbit** - Home services
- **Thumbtack** - Professional services
- **Airbnb** - Accommodation bookings

All Apple-approved, all use external payment processors.

## Testing

### Test Booking Payment

1. **Create booking** in app
2. **Stripe Checkout opens** (in-app browser on iOS)
3. **Use test card**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. **Complete payment**
5. **Verify booking** marked as paid
6. **Check tech receives** notification

### Test on iOS

```bash
yarn cap open ios
# Build and run on device
# Navigate to booking flow
# Complete payment with test card
```

## Environment Variables

```env
# Stripe (for bookings)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Apple IAP (for subscriptions/credits only)
APPLE_IAP_SHARED_SECRET=your_shared_secret
```

## Database Schema

Bookings table remains the same:

```sql
bookings:
  - servicePrice: decimal (tech's price)
  - serviceFee: decimal (12.5% platform fee)
  - totalPrice: decimal (servicePrice + serviceFee)
  - paymentStatus: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'refunded'
  - stripePaymentIntentId: varchar (Stripe PI ID)
  - stripeCheckoutSessionId: varchar (Stripe session)
  - paidAt: timestamp
```

## API Endpoints

### Create Booking Checkout
```
POST /api/stripe/create-booking-checkout
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Body:
{
  "bookingId": 123
}

Response:
{
  "sessionId": "cs_test_...",
  "url": "https://checkout.stripe.com/..."
}
```

### Webhook (Payment Confirmation)
```
POST /api/stripe/webhook
Stripe-Signature: {signature}

Body: Stripe event payload
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### ✅ Advantages
1. **Flexible pricing** - Techs set any price
2. **Apple-compliant** - Follows guidelines for real-world services
3. **Simpler** - One payment system for bookings
4. **Better UX** - No artificial price tiers
5. **Faster payouts** - Direct to tech's bank via Stripe Connect

### ❌ No Disadvantages
- Apple takes no commission (not using IAP)
- You keep full platform fee (12.5%)
- Stripe fees are standard (~2.9% + 30¢)

## Apple Review Response (If Asked)

If Apple reviewer questions Stripe usage for bookings:

> "Booking payments are for real-world nail services performed at physical locations outside the app. Per App Store Review Guidelines 3.1.1, apps may use payment methods other than in-app purchase for goods or services consumed outside the app. Our app connects clients with nail technicians for in-person appointments, similar to how Uber, TaskRabbit, and other service marketplace apps operate."

## Summary

- ✅ **Subscriptions**: IAP (digital content)
- ✅ **Credits**: IAP (digital content)
- ✅ **Bookings**: Stripe (real-world services)

This is the **correct and Apple-compliant** approach for a service marketplace app.
