# Wallet & Payout System

## Overview
Nail techs can now set up a Stripe Connect wallet to receive payments directly from client bookings. The platform automatically splits payments: techs receive the full service price, and the platform receives a 15% service fee paid by the client.

## Features

### For Nail Techs
- **Stripe Connect Integration**: Secure wallet setup through Stripe Express
- **Automatic Payouts**: Receive service payments directly to bank account
- **Dashboard Access**: View earnings, payouts, and transaction history
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time wallet status (Not Setup, Pending, Active)

### Payment Flow
1. Client books appointment and pays total amount (service price + 15% fee)
2. Payment is processed through Stripe
3. Service price is transferred to tech's Stripe Connect account
4. Platform fee (15%) is retained by the platform (which may include referral rewards)
5. Tech receives automatic payouts to their bank account

## Database Changes

### Tech Profiles Table
Added Stripe Connect fields:
```sql
ALTER TABLE tech_profiles 
ADD COLUMN stripe_connect_account_id VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN stripe_account_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'not_setup',
ADD COLUMN payouts_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN charges_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```
