You are editing a photo of a hand to apply nail art designs. Your ONLY task is to modify the fingernails while preserving everything else EXACTLY as it appears.

${imageInputsSection ? `IMAGE INPUTS:
${imageInputsSection}
` : ''}STRICT RULES:
1. Use the EXACT hand shown in the image - same number of fingers, same pose, same angle
2. MAINTAIN THE EXACT ORIENTATION AND ROTATION of the original hand image - DO NOT rotate the image by any degree
3. The output image MUST have the same orientation as the input image (if hand is horizontal, keep it horizontal; if vertical, keep it vertical)
4. DO NOT add, remove, or duplicate any fingers
5. DO NOT change the hand position, pose, or angle
6. DO NOT alter skin tone, lighting, background, or any other element
7. DO NOT add extra hands, arms, bodies, or props
8. ONLY modify the fingernail surfaces

NAIL ANATOMY & STRUCTURE (CRITICAL):
- Every nail MUST start from the nail matrix (the base where the nail grows from the finger/cuticle area)
- The nail should begin at the natural cuticle line and extend outward from there
- Even for VERY LONG nails (extra-long, stiletto, etc.), the nail MUST originate from the nail bed/matrix
- DO NOT create "floating" nails that appear disconnected from the finger
- DO NOT make nails that start mid-finger or appear to hover above the finger
- The nail base should be anchored at the cuticle, with the length extending naturally from that point
- For long nails: extend the length FORWARD from the fingertip, not by moving the base away from the cuticle
- Maintain realistic nail bed proportions - the visible nail should show both the nail bed (attached to finger) and free edge (extended portion)
- The nail should look like it naturally grew from the finger, regardless of length

NAIL DIRECTION & ORIENTATION ALIGNMENT (CRITICAL):
- ANALYZE the direction and angle of each fingernail in the original hand image
- Each nail has a specific orientation based on how the finger is positioned (pointing up, down, left, right, or at an angle)
- When applying the design from reference images, ROTATE and ALIGN the design pattern to match EACH individual nail's direction
- If a nail is pointing upward, the design should be oriented upward on that nail
- If a nail is pointing to the side, rotate the design to match that sideways orientation
- If nails are at different angles (e.g., spread fingers), each nail's design should follow its unique direction
- The design pattern should flow naturally with the nail's orientation, not be applied in a fixed direction
- Think of it like applying a sticker - you must rotate the sticker to match the surface direction
- CRITICAL: The same design element should appear correctly oriented on each nail based on that nail's individual angle and direction
- This ensures the design looks natural and professionally applied, not misaligned or sideways

${drawingImageUrl ? `
DRAWING/OUTLINE GUIDE (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- The user has drawn directly on the hand image to show EXACTLY where and how to apply the design
- This drawing is your PRIMARY GUIDE - it shows the exact placement, shape, and outline of the design
- Follow the drawn lines and shapes PRECISELY - they indicate the user's exact intent
- The drawing acts as a stencil or template for where the design should appear
- Respect the boundaries and shapes indicated by the drawing
- If the drawing shows specific patterns or outlines, replicate them exactly in the final design
- The drawing has MAXIMUM INFLUENCE - it overrides other parameters where there's conflict

NAIL DESIGN APPLICATION:

DESIGN IMAGES PROVIDED (${selectedDesignImages.length} reference${selectedDesignImages.length > 1 ? 's' : ''}, Influence: ${weights.designImage}%):
${weights.designImage === 0 ? '- IGNORE the design images completely.' : 
  weights.designImage === 100 ? `- CRITICAL: You MUST replicate the designs from the reference images with MAXIMUM ACCURACY
- Copy EVERY detail from the reference designs: exact colors, patterns, shapes, lines, and decorative elements
- The reference designs show the EXACT nail art that must appear on the fingernails
- If multiple reference images are provided, blend their elements harmoniously or apply different designs to different nails
- DO NOT interpret, simplify, or modify the designs - COPY THEM PRECISELY
- Match color values EXACTLY as they appear in the references
- Replicate all patterns, gradients, textures, and details with PERFECT FIDELITY
- If the references show specific nail art elements (flowers, lines, dots, etc.), reproduce them IDENTICALLY
- The design should look like a professional nail technician perfectly recreated the reference designs
- CRITICAL ALIGNMENT: Rotate and orient each design element to match the direction of each individual nail
  * If the reference shows a vertical pattern, apply it vertically RELATIVE TO EACH NAIL'S DIRECTION
  * If a nail points left, rotate the design to point left; if it points up, rotate the design to point up
  * Each nail gets the same design but rotated to match that nail's unique orientation and angle
  * This ensures the design looks professionally applied and naturally aligned with each nail
- Adapt the designs to fit each nail's shape AND orientation while maintaining ALL design details
${drawingImageUrl ? '- COMBINE the reference designs WITH the user\'s drawing guide - use the drawing for placement and the references for style/colors' : ''}
- DO NOT add any base color, background color, or additional elements not in the references
- USE ONLY what you see in the reference design images - nothing more, nothing less
- IGNORE any base color parameter - use ONLY colors from the reference images
- IGNORE any finish parameter - use ONLY the finish shown in the reference images
- IGNORE any texture parameter - use ONLY the texture shown in the reference images
- This is a DIRECT COPY operation with proper orientation alignment, not an interpretation or inspiration` :

- The drawing shows the EXACT design to apply - nothing more, nothing less
- IGNORE base color, finish, and texture parameters completely
- Use ONLY the visual information from the drawing and any reference images

NAIL SHAPE CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- The nail shape "${nailShape}" MUST be clearly visible and accurately formed on each nail
- Shape the entire nail structure to match this specific shape - not just the tip
- For "lipstick shape": Create a diagonal, asymmetric angled tip like a lipstick bullet (one side higher than the other)
- For "flare/duck nails": Make the nail tip noticeably wider and flared out compared to the base, spreading outward
- For "ballerina/coffin": Taper the sides inward then create a flat, straight tip
- For "stiletto": Create long, dramatically pointed nails
- For "almond": Taper to a soft, rounded point
- For "square": Keep edges straight with a flat, perpendicular tip
- For "squoval": Square shape with gently rounded corners
- The nail shape is a CRITICAL parameter - it must be obvious and correct in the final result

NAIL LENGTH CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Nail length "${nailLength}" refers to how far the nail extends BEYOND the fingertip
- CRITICAL: ALL nails must start from the nail matrix/cuticle area, regardless of length
- For "short" nails: Minimal extension beyond fingertip, but still starts at cuticle
- For "medium" nails: Moderate extension beyond fingertip, starts at cuticle
- For "long" nails: Significant extension beyond fingertip, starts at cuticle
- For "extra-long" nails: Dramatic extension beyond fingertip, starts at cuticle
- NEVER create floating nails - the base must always be anchored at the natural nail bed
- Length is achieved by extending FORWARD from the fingertip, not by detaching from the finger
- Even the longest nails should show a natural connection to the finger at the cuticle line

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Professional salon-quality nail art
- Realistic nail polish appearance with proper reflections
- Design follows natural nail curvature AND nail direction/orientation
- Clean, crisp edges at nail boundaries
- Consistent application across all visible nails with proper directional alignment
- Natural lighting and shadows preserved
- CRITICAL: Output image orientation MUST match input image orientation exactly (no rotation)
- CRITICAL: Each nail's design must be rotated to match that specific nail's direction and angle

OUTPUT: Return ONE image with the same hand, same number of fingers, same orientation and rotation, with nail art applied ONLY to the fingernail surfaces.
