# IAP Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

Your iOS app logs showed:
```
⚡️  [error] - Failed to load IAP products: {"code":"UNIMPLEMENTED"}
⚡️  [log] - Available IAP products: []
⚡️  [error] - Product not found in available products
```

**Root Cause:** The IAPPlugin wasn't properly registered with Capacitor, causing the "UNIMPLEMENTED" error.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Code Changes ✅

#### IAPPlugin.swift
- Added `CAPBridgedPlugin` protocol implementation
- Added explicit plugin identifier and JS name
- Added proper method registration array
- Fixed call handling with pending calls dictionary
- Improved lifecycle management (load/deinit)
- Better error handling and listener notifications

#### lib/iap.ts
Updated all product IDs to match bundle ID:
```typescript
// OLD (mismatched)
PRO_MONTHLY: 'com.yourcompany.ivory.business2'
BUSINESS_MONTHLY: 'com.yourcompany.ivory.pro'

// NEW (matches com.ivory.app)
PRO_MONTHLY: 'com.ivory.app.subscription.pro.monthly'
BUSINESS_MONTHLY: 'com.ivory.app.subscription.business.monthly'
```

All 13 product IDs updated to use `com.ivory.app.*` prefix.

### 2. Required Manual Steps (You Need To Do)

#### A. Xcode Configuration
```bash
npx cap sync ios
npx cap open ios
```

Then in Xcode:
1. Select "App" target
2. Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
3. Click "+ Capability"
4. Add "In-App Purchase"

#### B. App Store Connect Setup

Create these products at [appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com):

**Subscriptions (Auto-Renewable):**
1. `com.ivory.app.subscription.pro.monthly` - $19.99/month (Client Pro)
2. `com.ivory.app.subscription.business.monthly` - $59.99/month (Tech Business)

**Consumables (Credits):**
3. `com.ivory.app.credits.5` - $4.99
4. `com.ivory.app.credits.10` - $9.99
5. `com.ivory.app.credits.25` - $19.99
6. `com.ivory.app.credits.50` - $34.99
7. `com.ivory.app.credits.100` - $59.99

**Consumables (Booking Tiers):**
8. `com.ivory.app.booking.tier1` - $9.99
9. `com.ivory.app.booking.tier2` - $19.99
10. `com.ivory.app.booking.tier3` - $29.99
11. `com.ivory.app.booking.tier4` - $39.99
12. `com.ivory.app.booking.tier5` - $49.99

#### C. Testing Setup

1. Create Sandbox Tester in App Store Connect:
   - Go to Users and Access → Sandbox Testers
   - Create test account

2. Test on Real Device:
   - Connect iPhone/iPad
   - Build and run from Xcode
   - Sign out of real Apple ID
   - Use sandbox account when prompted

## Files Modified

- ✅ `ios/App/App/IAPPlugin.swift` - Plugin implementation
- ✅ `lib/iap.ts` - Product ID definitions
- ✅ Created `IAP_PLUGIN_FIX.md` - Detailed documentation
- ✅ Created `IAP_QUICK_FIX.md` - Quick reference guide

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Xcode: Added "In-App Purchase" capability
- [ ] App Store Connect: Created all 12 products
- [ ] App Store Connect: Products in "Ready to Submit" status
- [ ] App Store Connect: Created sandbox tester account
- [ ] Device: Real iPhone/iPad connected (not simulator)
- [ ] Device: Signed out of real Apple ID
- [ ] App: Built and running on device
- [ ] App: Navigate to billing page
- [ ] App: See products load successfully
- [ ] App: Try purchase with sandbox account

## Expected Success Indicators

### Before Fix
```
⚡️  [error] - Failed to load IAP products: {"code":"UNIMPLEMENTED"}
⚡️  [log] - Available IAP products: []
```

### After Fix
```
⚡️  [log] - Loading IAP products...
⚡️  [log] - Available IAP products: [
  {
    productId: "com.ivory.app.subscription.pro.monthly",
    title: "Pro Monthly",
    price: 19.99,
    priceString: "$19.99",
    currency: "USD"
  },
  {
    productId: "com.ivory.app.subscription.business.monthly",
    title: "Business Monthly",
    price: 59.99,
    priceString: "$59.99",
    currency: "USD"
  }
]
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Cannot connect to iTunes Store"
- **Cause:** Testing in Simulator
- **Fix:** Use real device

### "Product not available"
- **Cause:** Products not created in App Store Connect
- **Fix:** Create products with exact IDs listed above

### "Invalid Product ID"
- **Cause:** Product ID mismatch or not synced
- **Fix:** Wait 2-4 hours after creating products, verify exact IDs

### Still shows UNIMPLEMENTED
- **Cause:** Didn't rebuild after code changes
- **Fix:** Run `npx cap sync ios` and rebuild in Xcode

## Environment Variables

Already configured in `.env`:
```
APPLE_IAP_SHARED_SECRET=5baa4eb0b4334db9bb91b7fa6d24f9e4
```

This is used for server-side receipt validation.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Add In-App Purchase capability in Xcode
2. **Today:** Create products in App Store Connect
3. **Wait 2-4 hours:** Apple syncs products
4. **Test:** Build to real device and verify products load
5. **Purchase:** Test with sandbox account

## Camera Error (Separate Issue)

The camera error in your logs is unrelated to IAP:
```
[CAMCaptureEngine] Received a session runtime error notification : Error Domain=AVFoundationErrorDomain Code=-11800
```

This is expected in iOS Simulator. Camera works fine on real devices.
