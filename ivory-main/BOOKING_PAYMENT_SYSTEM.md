# Booking Payment System - Apple Compliance

## Overview

The booking payment system uses **Apple In-App Purchases (IAP)** exclusively for the native iOS app to comply with Apple's App Store guidelines. Stripe is only used on the web version accessed through browsers.

## Apple Compliance

✅ **IAP ONLY in Native App** - No Stripe references or alternative payment methods visible
✅ **Web uses Stripe** - Separate web version for browser users
✅ **Tech Payouts via Stripe Connect** - Backend only, not visible to app users
✅ **12.5% Platform Fee** - Transparent pricing disclosed to users

## Payment Flow - Native iOS App

### For Clients

1. **Client books appointment** → Selects service, date, time, and design
2. **IAP initiated** → App determines price tier and initiates Apple IAP
3. **Apple processes payment** → User completes payment through Apple
4. **Receipt validation** → Backend validates receipt with Apple servers
5. **Booking confirmed** → Payment marked as paid, tech receives notification
6. **Tech receives payout** → Funds transferred to tech's Stripe Connect wallet (backend only)

### For Techs

Techs setup their payout wallet through the app, but this is presented as "Payout Settings" without mentioning Stripe to maintain Apple compliance. The actual Stripe Connect onboarding happens in a web view.

## IAP Product Configuration

### Booking Payment Tiers

Configure these products in App Store Connect as **Consumable** products:

```
com.yourcompany.ivory.booking.tier1  // $0-50
com.yourcompany.ivory.booking.tier2  // $51-100
com.yourcompany.ivory.booking.tier3  // $101-150
com.yourcompany.ivory.booking.tier4  // $151-200
com.yourcompany.ivory.booking.tier5  // $201+
```

### Price Tier Mapping

The system automatically selects the appropriate product ID based on total booking price:

```typescript
if (totalPrice <= 50) → BOOKING_TIER_1
if (totalPrice <= 100) → BOOKING_TIER_2
if (totalPrice <= 150) → BOOKING_TIER_3
if (totalPrice <= 200) → BOOKING_TIER_4
if (totalPrice > 200) → BOOKING_TIER_5
```

## Tech Wallet Setup (Backend Only)

Techs setup their wallet through the app, but the actual Stripe Connect integration is:
- Presented as "Payout Wallet" or "Payment Settings"
- No mention of "Stripe" in the app UI
- Onboarding happens in web view
- Backend handles all Stripe API calls

### Wallet Status

- **Not Setup** → Tech hasn't started onboarding
- **Pending** → Onboarding started but not complete
- **Active** → Fully verified, can receive payouts

## Revenue Split

### Platform Fee: 15%

For every booking:
- **Service Price** → Goes to tech (via Stripe Connect backend)
- **Service Fee (15%)** → Platform revenue (this 15% may include referral rewards)
- **Total Price** → Service Price + Service Fee

### Example

Service Price: $80
Service Fee: $12 (15%)
Total Price: $92

- Client pays: $92
- Tech receives: $80 (transferred to their bank via Stripe Connect)
- Platform keeps: $12 (of which up to 5% of service price may be shared with a referring tech)

## API Endpoints

### IAP Payment Validation

```
POST /api/iap/validate-booking-payment
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Body:
{
  "receipt": "base64_encoded_receipt",
  "productId": "com.yourcompany.ivory.booking.tier1",
  "transactionId": "1000000123456789",
  "bookingId": 123
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "bookingId": 123,
  "paymentStatus": "paid"
}
```

### Tech Wallet Setup (Backend)

These endpoints are called from the app but don't expose Stripe branding:

```
POST /api/stripe/connect/onboard
GET /api/stripe/connect/status
POST /api/stripe/connect/dashboard
```

## Database Schema

### Bookings Table

```sql
bookings:
  - servicePrice: decimal (original service price)
  - serviceFee: decimal (12.5% platform fee)
  - totalPrice: decimal (servicePrice + serviceFee)
  - paymentStatus: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'refunded'
  - stripePaymentIntentId: varchar (stores IAP transaction ID with 'iap_' prefix)
  - paidAt: timestamp
```

### Tech Profiles Table

```sql
tech_profiles:
  - stripeConnectAccountId: varchar (backend only)
  - stripeAccountStatus: 'not_setup' | 'pending' | 'active'
  - payoutsEnabled: boolean
  - chargesEnabled: boolean
```

## Apple App Store Compliance Checklist

✅ **No Stripe Branding** - Zero mentions of Stripe in app UI
✅ **IAP Only** - All payments go through Apple IAP
✅ **No External Links** - No links to external payment pages
✅ **Transparent Pricing** - 12.5% fee clearly disclosed
✅ **Payout Settings** - Wallet setup presented as generic "Payout Settings"
✅ **Web View for Onboarding** - Stripe Connect onboarding in web view
✅ **Backend Integration** - All Stripe API calls server-side only

## Important Notes for Apple Review

1. **Never mention "Stripe"** in any user-facing text
2. **Use generic terms** like "Payout Wallet", "Payment Settings", "Bank Transfer"
3. **IAP is mandatory** for all in-app purchases
4. **Web version is separate** - different codebase/domain if needed
5. **Backend integration is allowed** - Stripe Connect for payouts is compliant

1. **Navigate to Settings** → Tech Settings page
2. **Setup Wallet** → Click "Setup Wallet" button
3. **Complete Stripe Onboarding** → Provide business info and bank details

## Revenue Split

### Platform Fee: 12.5%

For every booking:
- **Service Price** → Goes to tech (via Stripe Connect)
- **Service Fee (12.5%)** → Platform revenue
- **Total Price** → Service Price + Service Fee

### Example

Service Price: $80
Service Fee: $10 (12.5%)
Total Price: $90

- Client pays: $90
- Tech receives: $80 (transferred to their Stripe Connect account)
- Platform keeps: $10

### Stripe Connect Transfer

When tech has Stripe Connect setup:

```typescript
// Stripe Checkout with destination charges
{
  application_fee_amount: Math.round(serviceFee * 100), // $10 in cents
  transfer_data: {
    destination: techStripeConnectAccountId // Tech receives $80
  }
}
```

When tech doesn't have Stripe Connect:
- Payment still processed
- Funds held by platform
- Tech must setup wallet to receive payout

```sql
bookings:
  - servicePrice: decimal (original service price)
  - serviceFee: decimal (12.5% platform fee)
