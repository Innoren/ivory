## 🤖 Current: Two Models (Today)

### 1. gpt-image-1 🎨
**Job**: All image generation (concepts + previews)

**When**: 
- Design tab: Generate nail design previews
- AI Designs tab: Generate 3 concept images
- Upload tab: Generate preview with uploaded design

**Why this model**: Only publicly available image model

**Status**: ✅ In production

---

### 2. gpt-4o-mini 🧠
**Job**: Understand what the user wants (the "translator")

**When**: Only in AI Designs tab before generating concepts
- User types: "minimalist floral with pink tones"
- Model extracts: length=medium, shape=oval, color=#FF6B9D, etc.
- Returns: Structured JSON with all settings

**Why this model**: Super cheap, excellent at understanding text

**Status**: ✅ In production

---

## 🔮 Future: Three Models (When Available)

### 1. gpt-image-1-mini 🏃‍♂️💨
**Job**: Apply designs to user's hand (the "preview engine")

**When**: Every time you need to show the user what their nails will look like
- Design tab: User changes length/shape/color → instant preview
- AI Designs tab: User selects a concept → apply to their hand
- Upload tab: User uploads design → apply to their hand

**Why this model**: Fast + cheap = perfect for real-time updates

**Status**: ❌ Not yet public (will replace gpt-image-1 for previews)

---

### 2. gpt-image-1 🎨
**Job**: Create design concept images (the "idea generator")

**When**: Only in AI Designs tab when generating 3 concepts
- User types: "minimalist floral with pink tones"
- Model creates: 3 standalone nail design images
- These are NOT on the user's hand yet - just inspiration

**Why this model**: Higher quality for creative concepts

**Status**: ✅ In production (currently used for everything)

---

### 3. gpt-4o-mini 🧠
**Job**: Understand what the user wants (the "translator")

**When**: Only in AI Designs tab before generating concepts
- User types: "minimalist floral with pink tones"
- Model extracts: length=medium, shape=oval, color=#FF6B9D, etc.
- Returns: Structured JSON with all settings

**Why this model**: Super cheap, excellent at understanding text

**Status**: ✅ In production

## ⚡ Speed Comparison

```
gpt-image-1-mini:  ████░░░░░░  Fast (2-3 seconds)
gpt-image-1:       ██████░░░░  Moderate (4-6 seconds)
gpt-4o-mini:       ██░░░░░░░░  Very Fast (1 second)
```

## 🎯 The Golden Rule

**Use gpt-image-1-mini whenever you want to show the user's actual hand with nail art applied.**

That's it! Everything else is just supporting that goal.

## 🔄 Complete User Journey

### Scenario 1: Quick Design
```
1. User takes photo of hand
2. User picks "long" + "almond" + "pink" + "glossy"
   → gpt-image-1-mini applies design
3. User sees preview on their hand
4. User saves design
```

### Scenario 2: AI-Powered Design
```
1. User takes photo of hand
2. User types "minimalist floral with pink tones"
   → gpt-4o-mini analyzes prompt
   → gpt-image-1 generates 3 concepts
3. User sees 3 design ideas
4. User selects favorite
   → gpt-image-1-mini applies to their hand
5. User sees preview on their hand
6. User saves design
```

### Scenario 3: Custom Design
```
1. User takes photo of hand
2. User uploads inspiration image
3. Image stored in R2
   → gpt-image-1-mini applies design to hand
4. User sees preview on their hand
5. User saves design
```
