# Stripe Connect Compliance Guide (Uber Model)

## Overview

This guide explains how Ivory implements the Uber-style payment compliance model using Stripe Connect. This ensures legal compliance with payment regulations, tax laws, and KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements.

## How It Works

### 1. Platform Structure

**Ivory (Platform)**
- Merchant of record for all transactions
- Collects payments from clients
- Distributes funds to nail techs
- Handles compliance and reporting

**Nail Techs (Connected Accounts)**
- Independent service providers
- Receive transfers for completed services
- Must complete identity verification
- Payouts locked until verified

### 2. Compliance Requirements

Stripe automatically handles:

#### Identity Verification (KYC)
- Full legal name
- Date of birth
- Social Security Number (US) or Tax ID
- Government-issued ID verification
- Address verification

#### Bank Account Verification
- Bank account number
- Routing number
- Account ownership verification
- Micro-deposit verification (if needed)

#### Tax Compliance
- W-9 form collection (US)
- 1099 reporting for earnings over $600/year
- Tax ID verification
- Business structure documentation

#### Business Information
- Business name (if applicable)
- Business type (individual/company)
- Business address
- Phone number
- Website/social media

## Implementation Flow

### Step 1: Tech Signs Up
```
1. User creates account on Ivory
2. Selects "Nail Tech" user type
3. Completes basic profile setup
```

### Step 2: Wallet Setup Initiated
```
1. Tech clicks "Setup Wallet" button
2. Platform creates Stripe Connect Express account
3. Account ID saved to database
4. Status: "not_setup"
```

### Step 3: Stripe Onboarding
```
1. Tech redirected to Stripe-hosted onboarding
2. Stripe collects required information:
   - Personal information
   - Identity verification
   - Bank account details
   - Tax information
3. Stripe verifies information automatically
4. Tech completes onboarding
```

### Step 4: Verification & Activation
```
1. Stripe processes verification (usually instant)
2. Account status updated to "active"
3. Payouts enabled: true
4. Tech can now receive payments
```

### Step 5: Ongoing Compliance
```
1. Stripe monitors account activity
2. May request additional verification
3. Automatic tax document generation
4. Annual 1099 forms sent
```

## Account Statuses

### not_setup
- No Stripe account created yet
- Cannot receive payments
- Action: Click "Setup Wallet"

### pending
- Account created but verification incomplete
- Payouts disabled
- Action: Complete Stripe onboarding

### active
- Fully verified and operational
- Payouts enabled
- Can receive transfers

### restricted
- Account has compliance issues
- Payouts may be paused
- Action: Resolve issues in Stripe Dashboard

## Payment Flow

### When Client Books Appointment

```
1. Client pays $115.00 total
   - Service: $100.00
   - Platform fee: $15.00 (15%)

2. Stripe processes payment
   - Charges client's card
   - Holds funds in platform account

3. Service completed
   - Booking marked as "completed"
   - Transfer triggered to tech

4. Tech receives payout
   - $100.00 transferred to tech's Stripe account
   - Platform retains $15.00 fee (portion may be shared as a referral reward)
   - Tech's bank receives funds (2-7 days)
```

### Payout Schedule

**Standard (Default)**
- Automatic daily payouts
- 2-7 business days to bank account
- No additional fees

**Instant Payouts (Optional)**
- Available for eligible accounts
- Funds in minutes
- Small fee per payout (~1%)

## Compliance Checks

### Before First Payout

Stripe verifies:
- ✅ Identity confirmed
- ✅ Bank account verified
- ✅ Tax information collected
- ✅ No fraud indicators
- ✅ Terms of service accepted

### Ongoing Monitoring

Stripe continuously checks:
- Transaction patterns
- Dispute rates
- Refund rates
- Customer complaints
- Regulatory compliance

## Handling Non-Compliance

### Missing Information
```
Status: pending
Action: Tech must complete onboarding
Result: Payouts remain disabled
```

### Failed Verification
```
Status: restricted
Action: Tech must provide additional documents
Result: Payouts paused until resolved
```

### Account Restrictions
```
Status: restricted
Reasons:
- High dispute rate
- Suspicious activity
- Regulatory issues
Action: Contact Stripe support
```

## Tax Reporting

### For Nail Techs

**Earnings < $600/year**
- No 1099 required
- Tech reports income on tax return

**Earnings ≥ $600/year**
- Stripe generates 1099-K form
- Sent by January 31st
- Tech receives copy via email
- Filed with IRS automatically

### For Platform

- Stripe handles all 1099 reporting
- Platform doesn't need to file
- Stripe is the payment processor of record
